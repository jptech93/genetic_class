In Population->
Added parameter chromosome<T> * to rw_select and rank_select and therefore changed their call in renew...

In Chromosome->
fitness changed to double from float...

In class bstring->
changed s.append(char*) to s.append(size n,char) in string get_seq()
Was giving garbage values instead of 1's and 0's (since it expected the char pointer to terminate in \0)
started working after change..
